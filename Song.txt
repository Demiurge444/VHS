Drowning myself, over and over
Desolate, trying it's over
Why so cynical in life
You think you're living to die
All in wait, all in wait
Burning inside, long for answers
Makes no sense, trying it's over
Why so cynical in life
You think you're living to die (living to die, living to die...)
All in wait
Step down and smile at this fool
That believes his own word (his own word, his own word...)
All in wait
All in wait
Now I'm drowning myself over and over (drowning myself, I'm)
Desolate we're trying but you say it's over
All in wait
